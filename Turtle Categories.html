        <p>Sea turtles, freshwater turtles, and tortoises are among the many turtle species that may be found in Sri Lanka. The green turtle, hawksbill turtle, olive ridley turtle, loggerhead turtle, and leatherback turtle are among the five kinds of marine turtles that nest along Sri Lanka's coastline. Due to a number of concerns, including habitat degradation, poaching, and entrapment in fishing nets, all of these turtles are considered to be critically endangered or endangered.</p>
        <p>Sri Lanka is home to several freshwater turtles and tortoises in addition to marine turtles. The Sri Lankan black turtle, the spotted turtle, and the flapshell turtle are a few of the most prevalent freshwater turtles in Sri Lanka. The star tortoise and the leopard tortoise are two types of turtles that may be found in Sri Lanka.</p>

            Due to the population's reliance on the safety of a select few beaches in the Indian, Pacific, and Atlantic Oceans, this turtle is considered endangered.
            The Olive Ridley turtle, the smaller of the two species of ridley turtles, grows to a maximum size of 65 cm and weighs 35–45 kg. It gets its name from the color of its rusty-olive shell.
            Every year, Olive Ridley Turtles lay their eggs, and many of them deposit more than 150 at once on Kosgoda Beach. They consume fish, crabs, and some marine plants since they are omnivores.
            The most prevalent species of turtle in Sri Lanka is the Olive Ridley turtle. Their modest stature and olive-colored shells make these turtles distinctive. Large populations of Olive Ridley turtles are known to lay their eggs on Sri Lankan beaches, and their nesting season normally lasts from October to March.

            In Sri Lanka, the green turtle is the one that is most frequently encountered. The Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans all contain them. Thankfully, this practice is less widespread now. Carnivores predominate among young green turtles. Adults, however, are herbivores who use their sharply serrated jaws to solely consume marine flora.
            They may weigh up to 250 kg and reach a maximum length of 1m. A mature female will typically lay 120–140 eggs at a cycle. One of the biggest kinds of turtle in the world, these turtles are distinguished by their striking green shells. From January through July, Sri Lankan beaches are renowned to be the nesting grounds of green turtles.

            More uncommon than the Green Turtle is the severely endangered Hawksbill Turtle. Additionally, it is significantly smaller, with a maximum length of 90 cm and a weight range of 50–70 kg.The hawksbill's tiny head and bird-like beak, which are employed to hunt creatures hidden in small cracks, are what give it its English name. It frequently travels to tropical and subtropical seas, including Sri Lanka. Despite being one of the lesser sea turtle species, this one is recognized for having a stunning shell that is composed of 13 symmetrical sections and is incredibly colorful. They are among the most endangered turtle species in the world and are distinguished by having jaws that resemble beaks. From October through April, Hawksbill turtles are reported to lay their eggs on Sri Lankan beaches.

            The Loggerhead Turtle is uncommon in Sri Lanka and more frequent in the East Coast of the United States. As their name implies, they are often red and brown in color, and their huge head makes them easy to recognize!
            It weights between 170 and 200kg and reaches a height of 1m. They are mostly carnivores, and their powerful jaws are perfect for tearing apart mollusks and crustaceans.
            Sri Lanka is home to a unique kind of turtle known as the loggerhead. These turtles' great size and striking reddish-brown shells make them well-known. From October through March, loggerhead turtles are reported to lay their eggs on Sri Lankan beaches.

            This largest of the five kinds of turtle, which is severely endangered, is an uncommon discovery in Sri Lanka. It is still in danger of going extinct.
            Long front flippers and a distinctive shell with black and white stripes make it easy to recognize; the carapace, which gives the creature a leathery look, is actually a layer of thick, rubbery skin dotted with hundreds of bone plates. In actuality, it is the only sea turtle that does not have a hard shell.
            Additionally, despite being a cold-blooded reptile, they have a special blood circulation system that enables them to use the metabolic heat generated by their muscular activity to keep their blood warm even in chilly waters.
            The Leatherback may grow up to 3 meters long and weigh 750 kg. They can descend to depths of 1500 meters in quest of their favorite prey, the jellyfish, thanks to their distinctive flexible carapace and its seven ridges.
            Each year, Kosgoda Beach is reported to be the nesting site for 5 leatherback turtles.
            The world's biggest species of turtle, the leatherback, may also be found in Sri Lanka. One of the most endangered turtle species in the world, these turtles are distinguished by their characteristic leathery shells. From January through April, leatherback turtles are reported to lay their eggs on Sri Lankan beaches.
