                                One of the major hazards to turtles is overfishing. Turtles are frequently entangled on hooks and in fishing nets. Additionally, their flesh, shells, and eggs are harvested from them.
                                Turtles are seriously threatened by fishing nets. Fishing nets can ensnare sea turtles, causing them to drown. Even if they are not killed, they may have injuries that render them incapable of surviving.

                            <p>For their flesh, shells, and eggs, sea turtles are also murdered. Sea turtle flesh is prized in several cultures throughout the world as a delicacy. Jewelry and other items are made from sea turtle shells. Some regions of the world also consider sea turtle eggs to be a delicacy.
                            Turtles are seriously threatened by overfishing. There is a chance that many turtle species will become extinct if we do nothing to stop the overfishing.

                                In fishing nets, sea turtles are frequently ensnared as bycatch. This indicates that even if they are not the fishing operation's original target, they are nevertheless captured and killed.

                            <p>A significant issue in the fishing business is bycatch. Millions of sea turtles are taken as bycatch each year. Some of these turtles are released back into the water, but many of them are killed. However, even after being freed, they are frequently hurt and unable to live.

                            <p>Sea turtles are seriously threatened by climate change. Sea level rise brought on by climate change is killing sea turtle breeding sites. Additionally, as a result of climate change, the waters are become more acidic, which makes it more challenging for sea turtles to obtain food.
                            water turtle breeding sites are being devastated as the water level rises. Sand beaches are required for nesting and egg-laying by sea turtles. Sea turtles won't be able to breed if the beaches are devastated.

                            <p>The seas' acidity is also rising as a result of climate change. Because of this, it is challenging for sea turtles to locate food. Sea turtles consume a wide range of aquatic creatures, such as jellyfish, fish, and shrimp. Sea turtles are having a tougher time finding these creatures as the waters get more acidic.

            <li>Support conservation organizations: A variety of groups are devoted to preserving turtle habitats. By making a financial contribution or offering your time, you can assist these organizations.</li>
            <li>Reduce your seafood intake; one of the major dangers to turtle ecosystems is the fishing industry. By consuming less seafood, we can lower the market's demand for it and safeguard turtle ecosystems.</li>
            <li>When choosing seafood, make sure it's sustainable. If you decide to consume seafood, make sure you pick sustainable choices. You may choose sustainably with the aid of a variety of seafood guides.</li>
            <li>Be a responsible boater by taking care to avoid hitting turtles when you are out on the water. Boats frequently kill or hurt turtles.</li>
            <li>Throw rubbish away correctly; turtles might suffer if waste is dumped into the water. Never litter, and make sure to dispose of rubbish correctly.</li>
