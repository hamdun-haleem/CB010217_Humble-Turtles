    <!-- Sri Lankan Turtle Population -->

		<p class="population2">Homeland for variety of turtle species</p>
	</div>
    <div class="population3">
        <p>The Testudines (or Chelonii) order of reptiles includes turtles, which are distinguished by a distinctive bony or cartilaginous shell that forms from their ribs and serves as a defense. There are more than 327 different species of turtles, 294 of which are freshwater or land turtles and seven of which are sea turtles.</p>
		<p>There are five different types of sea turtles found in Sri Lanka: the green turtle, hawksbill turtle, olive ridley turtle, loggerhead turtle, and leatherback turtle. These risks, which include habitat degradation, poaching, and entrapment in fishing nets, have made all of these turtles either critically endangered or endangered.</p>
		<p>In Sri Lankan seas, the green turtle is the most prevalent marine turtle. It is a huge turtle with a maximum length of 1.5 meters and a maximum weight of 250 kilos. Herbivorous green turtles eat algae, seagrass, and other aquatic plants for food.</p>
		<p>The smaller hawksbill turtle may grow to a length of 90 centimeters and weigh up to 70 kilos. Carnivorous hawksbill turtles consume a range of invertebrates, such as jellyfish, sponges, and mollusks.</p>
		<p>The smallest marine turtle found in Sri Lanka is the olive ridley. It may weigh up to 45 kilos and reach a length of 70 cm. The omnivorous olive ridley turtle consumes a range of marine organisms and plants.</p>
		<p>The biggest marine turtle in Sri Lanka is the loggerhead. It may weigh up to 900 kilos and reach lengths of up to 2 meters. As carnivores, loggerhead turtles eat a range of fish, squid, and crabs.</p>
		<p>The most uncommon marine turtle in Sri Lanka is the leatherback. It may reach lengths of up to 3 meters and weights of up to 1,500 kilograms, making it the biggest living turtle in the world. Carnivorous leatherback turtles devour jellyfish for food.</p>
		<p>Due to a number of problems, Sri Lanka's turtle population is diminishing. Loss of habitat, poaching, and entrapment in fishing nets are the biggest risks. Because turtles require certain ecosystems to exist, habitat loss is a serious threat to them. Because turtles are sought for their flesh, eggs, and shells, poaching is a serious danger. Turtles can become caught in fishing nets and drown, making it a serious threat to them.</p>
		<p>
		Numerous groups are engaged in turtle conservation efforts in Sri Lanka. These groups are aiming to save turtle ecosystems, lessen poaching, and raise public awareness of the value of turtles.

							<h3>Turtle Hatchling and Egg Development</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="discription4-para">
							<p>Hatchling sea turtles emerge from their eggs after around 60 days of incubation. They crack the eggshell with a "egg tooth," a tiny, transient spike on their beak. The newly hatched turtles head straight towards the sea as soon as they hatch. The fact that they are prey for animals like crabs, birds, and fish makes this a perilous trek.</p><br>
							<p>Incubation of sea turtle eggs occurs in the sand. The gender of the hatchlings is determined by the sand's temperature. Males are produced by incubating eggs at colder temperatures, whereas females are produced by incubating eggs at higher temperatures. Depending on the type of sea turtle, the incubation time is normally between 60 and 70 days.</p>

							<h3>Turtle vs Tortise</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="discription4-para">
							<p>
								The reptile family includes both turtles and tortoises, although there are several key differences between the two. With their streamlined body and webbed feet, turtles are aquatic or semiaquatic organisms that can move quickly through the water. For safety, they may retract their limbs inside their flat shells, which are intended for water movement. The huge, dome-shaped shells and strong, elephantine legs of tortoises, on the other hand, distinguish them as land-dwelling reptiles. Due of their adaptation for walking on land, their feet are not webbed. The limbs of tortoises may only partially retract inside their shells, unlike those of turtles. 
							</p><br>
							<p>
								Tortoises are generally herbivorous, ingesting flora as their major source of food, whereas turtles are omnivorous, eating both plants and small animals. The slight differences between turtles and tortoises in their structure and preferred habitats show how each species has evolved to live an aquatic or terrestrial existence.

							<h3>Humans and Turtles</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="discription4-para">
							<p>The shallow seagrass meadows of the Indian Ocean, the vibrant coral reefs of the Coral Triangle, and the sandy beaches of the Eastern Pacific are all home to seven distinct species of sea (or marine) turtles. Sea turtles spend the majority of their lives in the water, despite the fact that these highly migratory animals occasionally come ashore to either bask or breed.</p><br>
							<p>Human activities have shifted the odds against the survival of these ancient seafarers during the past 200 years. Sea turtles are killed for their eggs, flesh, skin, and shells, and they are overfished and subject to poaching. In addition, their habitat is being destroyed, and bycatch—accidental capture—in fishing gear is a problem. Climate change influences turtle nesting locations by changing the temperature of the sand, which subsequently has an impact on the sex of the hatchlings. Almost all sea turtle species are currently considered endangered, with three of the seven recognized species in grave danger. Sea turtle population reduction must be stopped, and we should strive to preserve habitats that will allow both turtles and the humans who depend on them to survive.</p>

		<li><b>Turtles are among the world's earliest reptile species, predating snakes, crocodiles, and alligators.</b></li><br>
		<li><b>The bony, cartilaginous shell of a turtle makes them clearly identifiable. Some turtles may even tuck their heads up within their shell for added safety as this very durable coating serves as a barrier to guard them from predators.</b></li><br>
		<li><b>Contrary to what many people think, a turtle cannot emerge from its shell. They cannot get too huge since the turtle's shell expands along with them.</b></li><br>
		<li><b>Despite the fact that many species of turtles live in or near water, they are "amniotes," meaning they breathe air and lay their eggs on land.</b></li><br>
		<li><b>These species, who have cold blood, have very long lives. Tu'i Malila of Tonga Island, who was the oldest person ever documented, died at the ripe old age of 188.
